const defaultText = `When words are flashed on the screen one at a time, using a technique called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation, people can often read much faster than they would in normal reading. This method minimizes the need for eye movements, allowing your brain to process words more efficiently. Right now, you're reading at a speed of three hundred words per minute. At this pace, your eyes don't have to scan across lines of text. Instead, each word appears in the same spot, which can help you focus entirely on understanding the content. Many people can increase their reading speed to four hundred or even six hundred words per minute using this technique, while still maintaining good comprehension.`;
